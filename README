Just a simple TurboWieszcz file, but made in WASM.

1. Install rust:
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
2. Install wasm on rust:
cargo install wasm-pack
3. Go to the turbowieszcz directory, and do:
wasm-pack build --target web
4. You got it! Now you can run it with any web server, for example:
python3 -m http.server
5. Go to http://localhost:8000/ and open the index.html file in your browser.
